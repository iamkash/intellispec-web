# Document Delete 404 Error - Fix Applied

## Problem Summary

When attempting to delete asset documents (companies, sites, etc.), the system was returning **404 Not Found** errors for both GET and DELETE operations.

**Root Causes Identified:**

1. **Missing JWT Authentication Headers** (PRIMARY ISSUE)
   - Frontend `AssetCrudHandler.ts` was making fetch calls WITHOUT authentication headers
   - Backend requires authentication via JWT token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
   - Without auth, the backend was rejecting requests with 404/401

2. **Route Registration Order Bug** (SECONDARY ISSUE)
   - Route `/documents/by-relation/:field/:value` was registered AFTER wildcard route `/documents/:id`
   - This could cause Fastify to match specific paths incorrectly
   - Fixed by moving specific routes before wildcard routes

## Changes Applied

### 1. Backend: `api/routes/documents.js`

#### Route Order Fix
- **Moved** `/documents/by-relation/:field/:value` route BEFORE `/documents/:id`
- Ensures specific routes are matched before wildcard routes
- Prevents route collision issues

#### Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added comprehensive logging to GET `/documents/:id` endpoint
- Added comprehensive logging to DELETE `/documents/:id` endpoint
- Logs now show:
  - User context (email, userId, tenantId)
  - Platform admin status
  - Tenant mismatch detection
  - Document existence verification
  - Detailed error information

**Debug Output Example:**
```javascript
{
  id: "doc_1759580606978_jaz27f9c1",
  type: "company",
  userId: "user_123",
  userEmail: "admin@hfsinclair.com",
  tenantId: "t_hf_sinclair",
  isPlatformAdmin: false
}
```

If tenant mismatch is detected:
```javascript
{
  documentId: "doc_1759580606978_jaz27f9c1",
  documentTenantId: "t_other_tenant",
  userTenantId: "t_hf_sinclair",
  userEmail: "admin@hfsinclair.com",
  message: "Document exists but user cannot access it due to tenant mismatch"
}
```

### 2. Frontend: `src/utils/AssetCrudHandler.ts`

#### Added Authentication Helper Method
```typescript
private getAuthHeaders(): HeadersInit {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  if (!token) {
    throw new Error('Authentication required. Please log in again.');
  }
  
  return {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  };
}
```

#### Updated All API Calls to Include Authentication

**Methods Updated:**
1. ✅ `deleteDocument()` - GET verification + DELETE
2. ✅ `restoreDocument()` - PUT
3. ✅ `saveCompany()` - POST/PUT
4. ✅ `saveSite()` - POST/PUT
5. ✅ `saveAssetGroup()` - POST/PUT
6. ✅ `saveAsset()` - POST/PUT
7. ✅ `loadCompanies()` - GET
8. ✅ `loadSites()` - GET
9. ✅ `loadAssetGroups()` - GET
10. ✅ `loadAssets()` - GET

**Before:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch(getApiFullUrl(`/api/documents/${id}?type=company`), {
  method: 'DELETE'
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch(getApiFullUrl(`/api/documents/${id}?type=company`), {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: this.getAuthHeaders()
});
```

#### Improved Error Messages
- Added specific error for 401 (authentication failed)
- Enhanced 404 error message (item deleted or no permission)
- Better error context for debugging

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Restart Backend Server
```bash
cd api
node server.js
```

The enhanced logging will now show detailed debug information in the console.

### 2. Test Delete Operation

1. **Login** to the application (ensures JWT token is in localStorage)
2. Navigate to **Asset Management** page
3. Try to **delete a company** document
4. Should now work successfully!

### 3. Monitor Backend Logs

Watch for log entries like:
```
GET /documents/:id request
{
  id: "doc_...",
  type: "company",
  userId: "user_...",
  userEmail: "admin@example.com",
  tenantId: "t_tenant_id",
  isPlatformAdmin: false
}

Document found successfully
{
  id: "doc_...",
  type: "company",
  tenantId: "t_tenant_id"
}

DELETE /documents/:id request
{
  id: "doc_...",
  type: "company",
  hard_delete: false,
  ...
}

Document soft deleted
{
  id: "doc_...",
  type: "company",
  tenantId: "t_tenant_id"
}
```

### 4. Verify All CRUD Operations

Test the following to ensure authentication is working:
- ✅ Create company/site/asset group/asset
- ✅ Edit company/site/asset group/asset
- ✅ Delete company/site/asset group/asset
- ✅ Restore deleted items
- ✅ Load dropdown options (companies, sites, etc.)

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Success Case
1. User clicks "Delete" on a company
2. Frontend sends GET request with JWT token to verify document exists
3. Backend validates JWT, checks tenant access, returns document
4. Frontend sends DELETE request with JWT token
5. Backend validates JWT, checks tenant access, performs soft delete
6. Success message shown to user
7. UI refreshes to show updated list

### Authentication Error Case
1. If JWT token is missing or expired
2. Frontend shows: "Authentication required. Please log in again."
3. User is prompted to re-authenticate

### Permission Error Case
1. If user tries to delete document from another tenant
2. Backend logs: "TENANT MISMATCH DETECTED"
3. Frontend shows: "Cannot delete company: The item may have already been deleted or you don't have permission to delete it."

## Verification Checklist

Before marking this as complete:
- [ ] Backend server restarted
- [ ] Frontend rebuilt (if needed)
- [ ] User logged in (JWT token in localStorage)
- [ ] Can successfully delete a company
- [ ] Can successfully delete a site
- [ ] Can successfully delete an asset group
- [ ] Can successfully delete an asset
- [ ] Can successfully create/edit documents
- [ ] Can successfully restore deleted documents
- [ ] Backend logs show proper authentication context
- [ ] No more 404 errors for authenticated requests

## Architecture Notes

### Why Authentication Headers Were Missing

The `AssetCrudHandler` was using plain `fetch()` calls without passing authentication headers. This is different from:

1. **BaseGadget.makeAuthenticatedFetch()** - Automatically includes auth headers
2. **Axios interceptors** - Can add auth headers globally
3. **Framework fetch wrappers** - Can include auth by default

The `AssetCrudHandler` is a standalone utility class that doesn't extend `BaseGadget`, so it needs to manually manage authentication.

### Best Practice Going Forward

For any new API calls in utility classes:
1. Always include authentication headers
2. Extract JWT token from `localStorage.getItem('token')`
3. Add `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` header
4. Handle 401 errors gracefully (prompt re-login)

### Route Order Best Practices

In Fastify (and most routing frameworks):
1. Register **specific routes** FIRST
2. Register **wildcard routes** LAST
3. Order matters - first match wins

**Good Order:**
```javascript
fastify.get('/documents/stats', ...)      // Specific
fastify.get('/documents/by-relation/:field/:value', ...)  // Specific
fastify.get('/documents/:id', ...)        // Wildcard
```

**Bad Order:**
```javascript
fastify.get('/documents/:id', ...)        // Wildcard (catches everything!)
fastify.get('/documents/stats', ...)      // Never reached
fastify.get('/documents/by-relation/:field/:value', ...)  // Never reached
```
