## Technical Implementation

### Widget Integration

The AI chatbot is integrated as a widget in the `DocumentFormGadget`:

```typescript
// FormRenderer.tsx
<AIChatbotWidget
  id="form-ai-assistant"
  formSchema={formSchema}
  currentFormData={formData}
  currentSection={activeSection}
  onFieldUpdate={(fieldId, value) => {
    setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, [fieldId]: value }));
  }}
  // ... other props
/>
```

### Schema Understanding

The assistant automatically understands the form schema:

```typescript
// Automatically generated from fieldConfigs
const formSchema = Object.entries(fieldConfigs).map(([fieldId, config]) => ({
  id: fieldId,
  type: config.type || 'text',
  title: config.label || fieldId,
  required: config.required,
  sectionId: config.sectionId,
  // ... other properties
}));
```

### Context Awareness

The assistant maintains context about:
- Current form section
- Form data state
- Field relationships and dependencies
- Validation status
- Uploaded images and documents

## API 510 Specific Features

## Security & Privacy

- All API calls are made directly to OpenAI
- No data is stored on external servers
- Voice recordings are processed locally before transcription
- Images are analyzed but not stored permanently
- Form data remains in the local application

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Assistant not appearing**
   - Check if `aiAssistant.enabled` is set to `true`
   - Verify OpenAI API key is configured
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Voice input not working**
   - Ensure microphone permissions are granted
   - Check if `enableVoice` is set to `true`
   - Verify OpenAI API key has Whisper access

3. **Image analysis failing**
   - Check if `enableImageUpload` is set to `true`
   - Verify OpenAI API key has Vision access
   - Ensure image format is supported (JPG, PNG, etc.)

4. **Form field updates not working**
   - Check if `onFieldUpdate` callback is properly configured
   - Verify field IDs match between schema and form
   - Check browser console for validation errors

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:

```typescript
// In development
console.log('AI Assistant Debug:', {
  formSchema,
  currentFormData,
  currentSection
});
```

## Future Enhancements
