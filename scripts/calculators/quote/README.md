All calculators follow the flat uiDefinition schema and the vision conventions in scripts/calculators/README.md. Use `vision` tag when images are accepted.

## Status Table (Fireproofing Estimation)

| Calculator | Detailed description | Parameters to pass | Image or media input | Key outputs | Standard or ref | QA checks and notes | Formula |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PFP System Estimator | Passive Fire Protection system estimation with material thickness and coverage calculations | substrate_type, fire_rating_hours, system_type, surface_area, environmental_conditions, application_method | Structural drawings or photos | material_quantity, thickness_required, coverage_sqft, labor_hours, total_cost | ASTM E119, UL standards | Verify fire rating requirements; check substrate compatibility | Coverage = Area × Thickness × Waste_Factor |
| Intumescent Coating Calculator | Epoxy-based intumescent fireproofing estimation for structural steel | steel_type, fire_scenario, protection_hours, surface_area, primer_required, environmental_exposure | Steel structure photos | coating_thickness, material_volume, application_time, cure_time, cost_estimate | NASA specs, Petrochemical standards | Validate fire scenario requirements; check primer compatibility | Volume = Area × DFT × (1 + Waste%) |
