  "overview": "Externally, the vessel exhibits widespread coating failure and severe corrosion localized at stiffening rings, flanges, and small-bore nozzles. One small nozzle shows through‑wall perforation. Internals appear fair from limited views. The unit is stored on cribbing with corroded lifting lugs; reconditioning and code re‑evaluation are required prior to service.",
